Uncontrolled asthma can cause serious complications to the mother, including high blood pressure, toxemia, premature delivery, and rarely death. For the baby, complications of uncontrolled asthma include increased risk for stillbirth, fetal growth retardation, premature birth, low birth weight, and a low Apgar score at birth. Fortunately, asthma can be controlled with medical management and avoidance of known triggers. Most measures used to control asthma are not harmful to the developing fetus and do not appear to contribute to either miscarriage or birth defects.
